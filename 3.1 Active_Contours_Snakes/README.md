# Active Contours using Snakes Algorithm
----
## To run:
* ```python snakes.py -i <src path> -o <output path>```
* ```python snakes.py``` (using default values of 'images' & 'results' respectively)
* After running, for each image in the src path, the image would open
* click on the center of the contour with the left mouse key and hold till the radius you want, and release the mouse button
* Then press any key on the keyboard
* if the contour is captured correctly, you would see the image with the initially drawn contours
* if not, it would ask you again for the contour center and radius, for maximum of 5 trials.

## Output:
* Resulting contours and video of changes of contours are saved in output path.

### Samples of output are saved in results folder based on sample image in images
