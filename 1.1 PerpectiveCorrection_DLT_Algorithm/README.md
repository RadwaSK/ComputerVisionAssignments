## Assignment 1.1 including:
* DLT Algorithm 
* Normalized DLT Algorithm
* Perspective Correction
------------

### To run the code without normalization:
``` python eval.py -i <path to source images> -n <path to grount truth folder> -s <path to save output images in> ```

### To run the code with normalization:
``` python eval.py -i <path to source images> -n <path to grount truth folder> -s <path to save output images in> --norm ```

**N.B.: if your are running the code from the terminal inside this directory, you can choose not to path values for ```-i```, ```-n``` and ```-s```. They have default values as shown in the code**
